# LMAT
LED Matrix
The LMAT code will make use of the arduino to control a MAX7219 IC in order to control an 8x8 grid of LEDs via dot matrixing. 
The libraries used have yet to be determined but will be detailed below once that decision is made. 


This document will also act as a basic guide behind how the code works and how to make use of it. 
The end goal is to develop an LED grid so pretty it takes your mind off of the inevitable heat death of the universe.
